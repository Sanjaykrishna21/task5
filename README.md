step1="USE library;" Switch to the library database.

step2="SHOW TABLES;" Lists tables in the database.

step3= joined  2 tables using inner join.
 
step4= Then I tried to use a FULL JOIN, but Workbench does not support it, so we have to use the "UNION" workaround.

step5= and Finally, I used a LEFT JOIN
